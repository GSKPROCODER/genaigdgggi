# Project Name

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app) and is integrated with Google Sheets to provide real-time updates without the need for frequent code pushes. For more information on syncing Sheets with the React app, refer to the `leaderboard` and `navbar` folders, specifically the `apps-script.txt` file for setup instructions.

## Quick Start

To get the app running locally:

1. Clone this repository.
2. Install the required dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Run the app in development mode with `npm start`.

### Development Environment

- **Localhost**: The app will run at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).
- **Hot Reloading**: The page will reload automatically when you save changes.
- **Linting**: Any lint errors will be displayed in the console.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run the following commands:

### `npm start`

Starts the development server. The app will be viewable in your browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode. Learn more about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests).

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production. The build artifacts will be located in the `build` folder. React will be bundled and optimized for the best performance. The build files are minified, and the filenames will include hash values for caching purposes.

### `npm run eject`

**Warning**: This is a one-way operation. Once you run `eject`, you canâ€™t reverse the changes. It will expose all configuration files, allowing for full control over the build setup. Use this if you need more advanced configuration than provided out of the box.

## Deployment

Learn more about deploying the app in the [React deployment documentation](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment).

### Code Splitting

To improve performance, you can split your code into smaller chunks. Learn more about [code splitting](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/code-splitting).

### Bundle Size Analysis

You can analyze the bundle size to identify performance bottlenecks. Instructions are available [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/analyzing-the-bundle-size).

### Progressive Web App

This app can be made into a Progressive Web App (PWA). Follow the instructions [here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/making-a-progressive-web-app) to enable PWA features.

### Advanced Configuration

If you need to tweak the configuration further, refer to the [advanced configuration guide](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/advanced-configuration).

### Troubleshooting Build Issues
